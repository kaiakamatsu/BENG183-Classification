# Introduction 

# Why Classification? 

# What are the types of Classification algorithms? 
## k-Nearest neighbor 
The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) method is like asking your closest neighbors for advice. Imagine you're trying to figure out what type of an unknown vegetable is in your basket. You look at the labeled vegetables your neighbors have, compare them, and decide based on the most similar ones.

With the k-NN method you are: 
Prepare the data containing various data points with known classes or labels 
This is considered the training process
Introduce a brand new data point (the unknown vegetable) where you want to assign it to a class based on its characteristics. 
The k-NN algorithm identifies the k number of neighbors near the new data point based on similarity scores (using metrics such as Euclidean or Manhattan distancing). This is the concept of looking at your neighbors vegetables that are already labeled. 
These k neighbors will be considered most similar to the data point, where we can classify.

It is important to plot the validation curve in order to determine the optimal value for k.
